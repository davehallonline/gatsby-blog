    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a web Application Developer from Canterbury, UK. After graduating from The University of Hertfordshire with a degree in Computer Science, I've worked in most IT roles from low level PC building through to being an application developer.

Outside of work I'll normally be involved in family activities with my wife and boys or else you'll probably find me watching one of the many motorsport series I follow.

I'm a West Ham fan (don't hold it against me) and I'm part of the RaiderNation following the Raiders in the NFL</p>
